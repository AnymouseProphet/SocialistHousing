When the time-stamp on the title page of the canonical version of this manifesto reaches seven years of age the author authorizes free redistribution under the terms of the Creative Commons ``No Rights Reserved'' (CC0) license, effectively \emph{at that time} making the canonical version of this manifesto part of the Public Domain.

\subsection{Bookstore Sales Exception}

The Creative Commons license specified is a \emph{non-commercial} license.

I specifically give the following exception to bookstores that cater primarily to a Socialist, Communist, and/or Anarchist clientele:

You may print and sell physical \emph{unaltered} copies of this manifesto for a profit even before this manifesto is seven years of age. You may not however sell digital copies---those can only be provided for free. You also may not sell altered copies.

The digital signature serves no function in a printed copy. Removing the end two pages (single physical page with two-sided printing) that has the digital signature \emph{in the context of physical printing} is not considered alteration of this manifesto.

The `Bookstore Sales Exception' does not apply to wholesalers.

The primary purpose of this exception is to allow this manifesto to be included in `book bundles' that are sometimes offered. A secondary purpose is to provide access of a printed copy to people who do not have the ability to create a printed copy themselves.
