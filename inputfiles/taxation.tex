\section{No Taxation Without Representation}

\epigraph{``This is something I've been seeing for a long time. Rich people in this country only interact with other rich people. They live in gated communities, eat at restricted restaurants, and spend thousands on a watch.\\[1\baselineskip] They really have no reference for how Americans live.''}{\textit{@DPurdyJackson \\ Twitter---May 06, 2021}}

\noindent Tax rates are set by the `Ways and Means' committee which sends it to the House of Representatives which---upon their approval---sends it to the Senate for final approval.

In both houses, most representative make \money{174000} a year. This is \emph{before} all the income they earn from their conflict of interest investments. According to OpenSecrets.org\footnote{\url{https://bit.ly/33vPtDV}} over half of them are millionaires. According to Google, only 8--9\% of Americans in general are millionaires.

Those making poverty wages simply do not have adequate representation in government and therefore---as our founding fathers made very clear---should not be subject to taxation. Those who disagree are `Loyalists' and not `Patriots' by 1770s Boston standards.

I propose that federal taxation does not begin until income is at least 10\% higher than minimum wage in the most expensive place to live.

Let $G$ represent gross annual income and let $W$ represent the highest minimum wage as calculated by the The Thirty-Five Percent Plan (see page \pageref{thirtyfive}). Then the following formula defines the cut-off income for which no taxes are owed at the federal level:

\[
G = 1.10 \times (12 \times 21 \times 8 \times W)
\]

If $W$ ends up being, say, \money{30.00} an hour which is a very likely possibility, then the starting gross income for federal income tax would thus be:

\[
G = 1.10 \times (12 \times 21 \times 8 \times \money{30.00}) = \SI[group-separator={,}]{66528}[\$]{\per\year}
\]

I applaud CEO Dan Price. He set the minimum wage of his Seattle company to \money{70000} per year, very close to the the number produced above---Seattle being one of the places likely to have a \money{30.00} an hour minimum wage using `The Thirty-Five Percent Plan'. I do not not know how he came to that figure but it is very congruent with what my manifesto asks.

Note the median income in the United States in 2019 was \money{31133} per year. The majority of Americans do in fact live in poverty, just like they did in the so-called `Roaring 20s' that resulted in the Great Depression. The financially privileged---including members of both houses of Congress---are shielded from the very real poverty in America. They do not see it, they do not \emph{want} to see it.

To compensate for the taxes the United States Treasury loses from no longer being able to tax those in poverty---levy more aggressive progressive taxes on the wealthy like we did after the Great Depression---and close the incredible number of tax loopholes.

Companies like Uber (one of many) who purposefully rob the treasury\footnote{\url{https://bit.ly/3eI4I3a}} need to be prosecuted into oblivion. Dara Khosrowshahi and CEOs like him belong in federal prison. They are thugs that are no different than Al Capone. The apathy of Khosrowshahi towards the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi makes that extremely clear---life has little actual value to him.

This country should be funded by those with excess, not by those who are starving.
